1. Visit [ssstik.io](https://ssstik.io).
2. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click -> "Inspect").
3. Navigate to the "Network" tab.
4. Paste any TikTok video link in the input box on ssstik.io and click the download button.
5. Look for a network request named `abc?url=dl`.
6. Right-click on the request and choose "Copy as cURL (bash)".
7. Go to [curlconverter.com](https://curlconverter.com/) and paste the copied cURL command.
8. Convert the command to Python code and accordingly update the `cookies` and `headers` variables in your script.
